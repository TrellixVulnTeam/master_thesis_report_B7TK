\section{Conclusion}
In this thesis
\begin{itemize}
    \item A low-cost capacitive accelerometer \ac{IC} has been used to measure the output signal of an \ac{EMA} measurement setup
    \item An impulse hammer using a strain gauge load cell has been developed using low-cost components.
    \item Different conditioning filter circuits have been studied and tested for the impulse hammer signal
    \item An Arduino communication protocol has been developed
\end{itemize}
