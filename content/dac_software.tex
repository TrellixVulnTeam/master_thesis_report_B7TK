\section{Data acquistion}

The data acquisition system developed in this thesis is an open source Arduino based system consisting of multiple microcontrollers. All signal channels are transmitted to a central microcontroller before passing it to a computer that serves as visualization and analysis tool.

\subsection{Interfaces}

The interfaces are the connections and protocols between the different building blocks of the \ac{DAC} system. The interfaces are chosen based on the sensors used, and the expected data rate at the required cable length between each section. I.e.:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Between the analog \ac{LC} and the external \ac{ADC} in \figref{sfig:dac_comp_precond} and the \ac{MCU} integrated \ac{ADC}  in \figref{sfig:dac_comp_simple} respectively the signal transmission is analog.
    \item The register of the accelerometer \ac{IC} is accessed via \ac{SPI}
    \item The communication between \acs{MCU}s is rooted in \acs{RS}-485 differential transmission to accommodate for signal transmission over cable lengths greater than \SI{10}{\meters} and uses a specialized protocol to keep data packages as small as possible.
    \item Between the \ac{MCU} and the \ac{CPU} \ac{USB} transmitts data using the serial class of the Arduino software.
\end{itemize}


    output signal that must be amplified by an \ac{IN-AMP} to scale up the signal to the operating range of the consecutive components.

. to of smart sensor IC are predetermined. With \ac{SPI}Standard interfaces, determined by senor ic

\subsection{Dataflow}

All \acs{MCU}s operate sequentially.
The dataflow in \ac{MCU} must be sequential. For this reason all data passed to a central \ac{MCU}

In the case of multiple acceleroemeters 
multiple accelerometers, master requests for data in slave buffer cyclic, changes slave, limits of arduino library,

\subsubsection{MCU communication protocol}

The communication protocol between microcontrollers and between microcontroller and computer was developed for this project.

\section{Software}

The software developed during this project is split into the Arduino software running on the \acs{MCU}s and a python based tool to receive and visualize the data via \ac{USB}.

The requirements to the software tools are:
\begin{enumerate}[label=m\arabic*]
    \item Read out accelerometer and \ac{LC} data at the maximum sample speed of the accelerometer \ac{IC}.
    \item Synchronize measurements timestamps
    \item Initialize measurement by hammer impulse
\end{enumerate}
    
\begin{enumerate}[label=w\arabic]
    \item Continuous real time output of measurement data
    \item Cache clearing
\end{enumerate}
