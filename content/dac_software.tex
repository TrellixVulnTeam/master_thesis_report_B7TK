\section{Data acquistion}

The \ac{DAC} system developed in this thesis is an open source Arduino based system consisting of multiple microcontrollers. All signal channels are transmitted to a central microcontroller before passing to a computer that serves as visualization and analysis tool.

\subsection{Building Blocks}

Building blocks are the main components used in the \ac{DAC} signal chain. Additional components that are required to enable the stable operation of the building blocks are not listed.

Because the of accelerometer \ac{IC} output interfaces it is not possible to connect all sensors directly to one \ac{MCU} that acts as a \ac{DAC}. We need to transform the signal to a different interface. A low-cost and versatile method to achieve this, is to use a \ac{MCU} for each accelerometer \ac{IC}. These read the sensor \ac{IC} registers and communicate to the \ac{MCU} master. The master, on the other hand, acts as a passthrough and transmits the data to the \ac{CPU}. In the setup used, it also reads out the \ac{LC} signal. \tabref{tab:mcu_used} lists the \ac{MCU}s used during this thesis.% Other components can be found in \autoref{apx:appendix}.

The analog signal output of the \ac{LC} needs to be amplified to match the input range of the \ac{ADC}. To gain the maximum resolution, this depends on the expected input range. To get a higher value resolution than offered by the \ac{MCU} embedded \ac{ADC} one can set in an external \ac{ADC} \ac{IC} upstream to the \ac{MCU}. Additionally, we use a \ac{LPF} in \figref{sfig:dac_comp_precond}. The \ac{LPF} is needed to cut off high frequency components of the signal that occur particularly in sharp impulse signals. This design choice may lead to problems because it is not standard procedure in the development a measurement instrument. Typically, components in the analog signal chain are chosen, based on the frequency bandwidth of the input signal. This means, the cut-off frequency of the \ac{LPF} is set well above the signal's bandwidth. But because we use low-cost components in our system, the bandwidth is limited to half the sampling rate of the slowest sensor. According to the Nyquist frequency theorem, the cut-off frequency then needs to be reduced to half the sampling frequency, potentially reducing the output magnitude of higher frequency components of the signal.

\subsection{Interfaces}

The interfaces are the connections and protocols between the different building blocks of the \ac{DAC} system. The interfaces are chosen based on the sensors used and the expected data rate at the required cable length between each section. I.e.:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Between the analog \ac{LC} and the external \ac{ADC} in \figref{sfig:dac_comp_precond} and the \ac{MCU} integrated \ac{ADC}  in \figref{sfig:dac_comp_simple} respectively the signal transmission is analog.
    \item The register of the accelerometer \ac{IC} is accessed via \ac{SPI}
    \item The communication between \acs{MCU}s is rooted in \acs{RS}-485 differential transmission to accommodate for signal transmission over cable lengths greater than \SI{10}{\meter} and uses a specialized protocol to keep data packages as small as possible.
    \item Between the \ac{MCU} and the \ac{CPU} \ac{USB} transmits data using the serial class of the Arduino software.
\end{itemize}

Data rates and package sizes are critical when sampling at high frequencies. 

With \ac{RS}-485 data can be transmitted over distances of no less than \SI{100}{\km} at a data rate of \SI{1}{\kilo bit\per\second}. At \SI{1200}{\meter} cable length we can reach data rates of around \SI{100}{\kilo bit\per\second}. In our range of application, i.e. a few tens of \si{\meter}, we can expect data rates of \SI{1}{\mega bit\per\second}, thus representing the bottle neck in the digital data chain. If we then transmit \SI{80}{bit} acceleration measurements (see \figref{fig:data_flow}) at \SI{1.6}{\kilo\hertz} we stay below this expected limit by a safety factor of more than 10.
The arduino the serial package parses all data as human readable code, specifically \acf{ASCII}. In this format every digit of integer values is passed as \SI{8}{bit}-value. Which means that a \SI{32}{bit} timestamp and every single axis acceleration are passed as ten \SI{8}{bit}-values and six \SI{8}{bit}-values respectively. This increases the size of an accelerometer package to \SI{624}{bit}, which in turn reduces the safety factor to approximately 1.
It is clear that one cannot use human readable code to transmit the data and guarantee stability at the required sampling rate.


\subsubsection{MCU communication protocol}

The communication protocol for \ac{MCU} to \ac{MCU} and \ac{MCU} to computer was developed for this project.

\subsection{Dataflow}

All \acs{MCU}s operate sequentially.
The dataflow in \ac{MCU} must be sequential. For this reason during a measurement all data is passed to a central \ac{MCU}, where it is streamlined to the \ac{CPU}. The central \ac{MCU} or master cycles through all connected \ac{MCU} performing a data request, hold and receive action. As soon as a slave \ac{MCU} gets a request, it transmits a data package from its buffer. The master now receiving the data package will throughput the signal to the \ac{CPU}, where it is stored. By the end of this process the master will jump to the next slave.

All measurements consist of a \SI{32}{bit}-timestamp and the measured values and are pushed into a \ac{FIFO} buffer in the flash memory of the \ac{MCU}, directly connected to the sensor. Bundled data packages are then pulled from the buffer and translated into the transmission code as defined in \tabref{tab:mcu_com_protocol}. In \figref{fig:data_flow} the data flow is represented by a system that is using only one slave \ac{MCU}, displayed in violet.

Measurements are packaged due to the time the master requires to change the communication to another slave. During these switches no data is transmitted eventually bottlenecking the data rate of the system.

\section{Software}

The software developed during this project is split into the Arduino software running on the \acs{MCU}s and a python based tool to receive and visualize the data via \ac{USB}.

For the instrument to work, some functions are required, while other desired functions are tools that simplify the workflow during measurements and facilitate bug fixes in the software.

The requirements to the software tools are:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\emph{m\arabic*}, itemindent=3em, labelsep=2em]
    \item Read out accelerometer and \ac{LC} data at the maximum sample speed of the accelerometer \ac{IC}.\label{req:read_out}
    \item Synchronize measurements timestamps.\label{req:sync}
    \item Initialize measurement by hammer impulse.\label{req:init}
\end{enumerate}

The desired software tools are:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\emph{w\arabic*}, itemindent=3em, labelsep=2em]
    \item Generate continuous real time output of measurement data.\label{des:cont_out}
    \item Track data transfer via \ac{USB}.\label{des:dat_track}
\end{enumerate}
