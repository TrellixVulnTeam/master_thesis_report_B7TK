\section{Motivation}
The \ac{EMA} is a powerful tool for evaluating dynamic models of structures. Despite its extensive usage in the aerospace industry, in many other engineering fields the benefits of \ac{EMA} are overshadowed by the initial investment and the operator costs of an \ac{EMA} system. Progress in \ac{MEMS} enables a different branch of sensors to be used for \ac{EMA}.

\section{Related Work}
In the field of civil engineering bridges and skyscrapers require continuous vibration signal logging for structural health monitoring. This leads to an increased interest in driving down the cost of accelerometer based monitoring systems. {Bla bli and blu}\todo{Names of civil engineers developing low cost systems} have developed low-cost \ac{MEMS} systems for structural health monitoring of civil structures. {Bli, bla and blu}\todo{Names of civil engineers that developed wlan systems} have expanded on this idea by interfacing the system via a \ac{WLAN} protocol.
{Somebody}\todo{Engineer using Instrument piezo} developed an modal test system, which uses piezo load cells that are typically used to tune musical instruments as response sensors. \citeauthor{waltham2009construction} implemented a piezo load cell that is designed to trigger barbeque lighters in a modal impact hammer \cite{waltham2009construction}.
